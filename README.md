# React + Blockchain with Solidity

## Project Description

This project is a **blockchain-based degree verification system** that integrates modern web technologies with blockchain to ensure secure and transparent academic credential verification.

## Key Features

- **Blockchain Integration**  
  Built on the **Ethereum blockchain** using **Solidity smart contracts**, enabling immutable and secure storage of degree records.

- **Node.js API Gateway**  
  A **Node.js backend** serves as an API gateway, facilitating communication between the frontend and the blockchain network.

- **React Frontend**  
  A **React-based graphical user interface (GUI)** allows users to:
  - Submit and verify degrees
  - Interact with smart contracts easily
  - View transaction and verification status in real time

- **Smart Contracts (Solidity)**  
  Custom smart contracts manage:
  - Degree issuance and storage
  - Verification logic
  - Role-based access (universities, verifiers, graduates)

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend/API**: Node.js, Express  
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, Solidity, Web3.js or Ethers.js  
- **Development Tools**: Hardhat or Truffle for smart contract development and testing
